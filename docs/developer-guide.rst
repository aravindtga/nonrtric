Developer Guide
===============

This document provides a quickstart for developers of the Non-RT RIC parts.

Additional developer guides are available on the `O-RAN SC NONRTRIC Developer wiki <nonrtricwiki_>`_.

Kubernetes deployment
---------------------

The Non-RT RIC rApp Manager can be also deployed as part of an `Integrated SMO Deployment <itdepsmowiki_>`_ in a Kubernetes cluster, and instructions can be found in the `OSC it/dep repository <https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/admin/repos/it/dep>`_, 
particularly in the *./smo-install* directory.

For more information on installation of Non-RT RIC and SMO components in Kubernetes, see `Deploy NONRTRIC in Kubernetes <nonrtricwikik8s_>`_.
